# PatchyMC
C++ version of monte carlo patchy particle simulation in the Gibbs ensemble
I wrote this code when I started learning Monte Carlo simulation. My goal was to reproduce the results in this article:

Kern, Norbert, and Daan Frenkel. "Fluidâ€“fluid coexistence in colloidal systems with short-ranged strongly directional attraction." The Journal of chemical physics 118.21 (2003): 9882-9889.

So if you're working on a similar project and don't have the time to code from scratch, maybe this might be helpful. Feel free to email me if you need more clarification on how the code works. But I recommend using the book "Understanding Molecular Simulations" by Frenkel and Smit.
