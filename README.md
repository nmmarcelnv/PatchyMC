# PatchyMC
C++ version of monte carlo patchy particle simulation in the Gibbs ensemble
I wrote this code when I started learning Monte Carlo simulation. I have used to code to simulate phase separation in protein systems as described in this [Nguemaha, Valery, and Huan-Xiang Zhou. "Liquid-liquid phase separation of patchy particles illuminates diverse effects of regulatory components on protein droplet formation." Scientific reports 8 (2018)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25132-1) 

So if you're working on a similar project and don't have the time to code from scratch, maybe this might be helpful. Feel free to email me if you need more clarification on how the code works. But I recommend using the book "Understanding Molecular Simulations" by Frenkel and Smit.
